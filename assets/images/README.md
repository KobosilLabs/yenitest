# Image Assets

This directory contains placeholder references for images that would be loaded from external URLs in the actual application.

In a production environment, you would:
1. Design custom images for the app
2. Store them in appropriate formats (PNG/SVG for icons, JPG/WebP for photos)
3. Optimize them for mobile use

For this demo, we're using external image URLs from Pexels.
